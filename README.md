# yt-playlists-delete-enhancer

This is a little user script for Tampermonkey who aim to resolve a simple issue with Youtube:

The lack of fine tuning about which videos you want to delete from your playlists.
Youtube recently added a button "Delete watched videos" for the watch later playlist. But this button will
delete EVERY started watched videos. Even the ones you didn't finished to watch yet.


This script solve the issue by adding a button on Youtube to remove watched videos with more 
than X percent from any playlist.
